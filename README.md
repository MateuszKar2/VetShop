# VetShop

**VetShop** is my latest project, currently under development. It aims to be a web application for an online veterinary shop. The project is built using **TypeScript**, **React** for the front-end, and a back-end component to handle various store-related functionalities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ‚Äì For static typing and better code quality
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) ‚Äì Front-end framework for building user interfaces
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) ‚Äì Backend server runtime environment
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) ‚Äì Backend framework for handling routes and requests
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) ‚Äì NoSQL database (if used for the project)
- [JWT Authentication](https://jwt.io/) ‚Äì Authentication for users and admin access (if applicable)

## üöÄ Getting Started



üìù Project Development Steps
1. Project Initialization
Initialize the project using create-react-app with the TypeScript template. This will create the skeleton of the application with the necessary configuration files.

2. Folder and File Structure
Organize the project folder structure to keep it clean and maintainable. Create folders for components, pages, styles, and TypeScript types.

3. Install Dependencies
Install additional dependencies such as:

React Router (for navigation)

Axios (for HTTP requests)
npm install react-router-dom axios

4. Configure Router
Set up React Router to handle navigation across different pages (e.g., home page, products page, product details, cart page).

5. Create Components
Create reusable components that will be used across pages, such as:

Header (navigation bar)

Footer (footer with copyright information)

ProductList (to display a list of products)

ProductItem (to display a single product)

6. Create Application Pages
Set up pages for the different sections of the store:

HomePage (welcome page with general store information)

ProductsPage (page displaying a list of products)

ProductDetailPage (page showing detailed information about a single product)

CartPage (page displaying items in the shopping cart)

7. API Communication
Integrate the application with an external API or your own backend to fetch product data (e.g., using Axios to make HTTP requests).

Handle API requests to display product information on the pages.

8. State Management
Use React Context API to manage the application's state, such as storing the cart contents, user status, etc.

9. Styling
Design and style the application using CSS. You may also consider using CSS frameworks or libraries, such as:

Styled-components

TailwindCSS

Material UI

10. Testing
Run the application locally and test all features, such as:

Navigation between pages

Adding products to the shopping cart

Loading data from the API

Form validation (e.g., cart, user registration)

11. Optimization
Ensure that the application is fast and efficient by:

Optimizing images

Using lazy loading for components

Enabling code minification and compression during the build process

12. Deploy (Publishing)
Once the app is ready, choose a platform to deploy it:

Netlify or Vercel for simple deployment from GitHub repositories

Heroku for applications with a backend

GitHub Pages for static applications

13. Maintenance and Development
After deployment, regularly check for bugs, monitor performance, and add new features based on user feedback (e.g., user login, product reviews, etc.).
