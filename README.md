 # VetShop

**VetShop** is my latest project, currently under development. It aims to be a web application for an online veterinary shop. The project is built using **TypeScript**, **React** for the front-end, and a back-end component to handle various store-related functionalities.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – For static typing and better code quality
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – Front-end framework for building user interfaces
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) – Backend server runtime environment
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) – Backend framework for handling routes and requests
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) – NoSQL database (if used for the project)
- [JWT Authentication](https://jwt.io/) – Authentication for users and admin access (if applicable)
